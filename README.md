# Professional README Generator
  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

  ## Description
  When creating an open-source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. For this project I have create a README generator, which will create a professional README file by prompting the user to input the following: Project title, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests. In this README generator, the user can upload an image too.

  - [Contribution](#contribution)
  - [Tests](#tests)

  ## Installation
  Firstly, when you have pulled the repository, make sure to install Node.js from nodejs.org on to your computer. Secondly, open terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory. Finally, Type `node index.js`. You are now ready to use the README generator.
  ## Usage
  This allows the project developer to devote more time to working on the project rather than spending time creating a README file. It encourages uniformity between projects, makes comprehension easier with standardised formatting, and makes it accessible to developers with different degrees of experience.
  ## Contribution
  First, fork the repository on GitHub and then clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`. After, create a new branch for your changes using the command `git checkout -b branch-name`. Make modifications to the code or files as necessary. Next, Ccmmit your changes using the command `git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"`. Then, push the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub with the command `git push origin branch-name`. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and submit a pull request. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request outlining the changes made. Finally, once your pull request is approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch of the README Generator repository.
  ## Tests
  Currently there are no tests. However, in the future if you wish to run tests please use the `npm test` command in the terminal.
